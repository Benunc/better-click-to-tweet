== Description ==

= The Best Click To Tweet Plugin on the Market, FREE! =

This plugin allows you to easily create tweetable content for your readers. Using a simple shortcode, your selected text is highlighted and made tweetable. 
><strong> Why Better?</strong><br>
>This plugin started as a complete retool of the "Click To Tweet" plugin by Todaymade. There are a number of improvements under the hood, namely correct character counting when dealing with non-Roman characters, providing multi-language support, and use of the official shortcode API (which means security and forward-compatibility)

I am working on a tutorial to switch to my plugin from any other similar plugin in a way that doesn't mean you have to switch every shortcode or pseudo-shortcode by hand. Stay tuned! 

Don't be scared to donate, if this plugin makes your blogging life any better.

Also, developers, please hop in and suggest improvements. You can submit pull requests at the [github repo](https://github.com/Benunc/better-click-to-tweet "plugin github repo") for this plugin, or go through the official svn repo here. I'm also actively seeking translators to bring the usefulness of this plugin to non-English speakers. Please message me in the forums.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How Does Better Click To Tweet Work? =
Better Click To Tweet enables you to create beautiful Click To Tweet boxes in your blog posts. Once you've installed and activated the plugin, click on the settings link to put in your Twitter username, and save the settings. 

Then, wherever you want to insert a Click to Tweet quote, use a shortcode in the format `[bctt tweet="xxxxxxxxxxxx"]` replacing the xxxxxxx with your tweetable quote. 

In the visual editor, you can click the blue birdy icon in the toolbar and a correctly formatted shortcode will be inserted in your text. For more info or clarifications, start a [support thread](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/better-click-to-tweet "support forum"). I'll actively answer.

= What do I do if it's not working right? =
I am active in [the support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/better-click-to-tweet "Better CTT Support"), and in patching the plugin. Start a thread there, and I will gladly help you out. Most of the time you can expect a few hours before a response. I'm in the eastern US, and I like playing with my kids at night, so you might not hear back immediately. Don't panic. 

= What are the differences between this plugin and Click To Tweet by Todaymade? =
I originally was planning on contacting Justin at Todaymade to suggest some improvements to the code on his plugin, and in the midst of that, his plugin was unexpectedly pulled from the official repository, for having a (frowned upon) "Powered By" link. So, I set about fully overhauling the plugin. 

Since that time Justin and the team over at Todaymade have rereleased a version of their plugin without the "Powered By" link. His plugin (which was originally released before the advent of the shortcode API) still doesn't use it, and for that reason is less secure than mine. For him to change to support the shortcode API is a more comlicated issue, as he'll need to still provide support for how his plugin currently handles the pseudo-shortcode system, or risk breaking every current user's website. 

The bottom line for an end user is that both plugins are great, with the main difference being mine using the official WordPress shortcode API, and some other minor tweaks to the code. For example, my plugin adds some calculation based on the length of your Twitter handle to prevent truncated tweets from still being over 140 characters. 

Also from an end user perspective, I am more active in the support forums than Justin (who has a paid product to support, which justifiably takes more of his time and energy), and you can count on my response and resolution to your issues! 

= How can I help? =
I want to maximize the usefulness of this plugin by translating it into multiple languages. So far I have included Spanish. If you have experience translating .po files, please consider helping in that way. To include those translations in the official plugin, email me, or submit pull requests at Github.
