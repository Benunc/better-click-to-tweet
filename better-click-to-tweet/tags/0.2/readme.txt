This plugin allows you to create beautiful Click To Tweet boxes anywhere in your blog post.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to easily create tweetable content for your readers. Using a simple shortcode, your selected text is highlighted and made tweetable.

This is a complete retool of the late "Click To Tweet" plugin by Todaymade. It now uses the WordPress shortcode API, making it more secure, and I've cleaned up the CSS from the old plugin. Perhaps most significantly, I removed the "powered by Coschedule" link.

Don't be scared to donate, if this plugin makes your blogging life any better.

Also, developers, please hop in and suggest improvements. You can submit pull requests at the [github repo](https://github.com/Benunc/better-click-to-tweet "plugin github repo") for this plugin, or go through the official svn repo here.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How Does Better Click To Tweet Work? =
Better Click To Tweet enables you to create beautiful Click To Tweet boxes in your blog posts. Once you've installed and activated the plugin, click on the settings link to put in your Twitter username, and save the settings. 

Then, wherever you want to insert a Click to Tweet quote, use a shortcode in the format `[bctt tweet="xxxxxxxxxxxx"]` replacing the xxxxxxx with your tweetable quote. 

In the visual editor, you can click the blue birdy icon in the toolbar and a correctly formatted shortcode will be inserted in your text. For more info or clarifications, start a [support thread](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/better-click-to-tweet "support forum"). I'll actively answer.

= What do I do if it's not working right? =
I am active in [the support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/better-click-to-tweet "Better CTT Support"), and in patching the plugin. Start a thread there, and I will gladly help you out. Most of the time you can expect a few hours before a response. I'm in the eastern US, and I like playing with my kids at night, so you might not hear back immediately. Don't panic.
