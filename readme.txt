== Description ==

= The most popular Click To Tweet Plugin for WordPress (by a mile), for good reason. =

Create tweetable content for your readers, using a simple shortcode or Gutenberg block. Readers are encouraged to tweet out both a quote, and a link to your content.

* [Add Premium Styles](http://benlikes.us/bcttps "Premium Styles add-on") with just a few clicks.
* Using the shortcode method in the classic editor? See our [Power User Guide](http://benlikes.us/7r "power user guide") for all the tricks (remove or change the "via," make links nofollow, change the callback URL, and more!).

><strong> Why Better?</strong><br>
>Back in the day, there was only one or two options for Click to Tweet plugins. They didn't do a lot of things I wanted them to do, so I made this plugin. I'm bad at naming things, so "Better Click To Tweet" it is. Since then, I've made so many changes and enhancements that any resemblance to the original inspiration plugins are long gone.

**Developer? Designer? Geek of any sort?** Please hop in and suggest improvements. You can create issues or submit pull requests at the [github repository](https://github.com/Benunc/better-click-to-tweet "plugin github repo") for this plugin.

Translation is managed at [the official WordPress translation page](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/better-click-to-tweet "WordPress translation").

== Installation ==

**To install the plugin manually in WordPress:**

1. Login as Admin on your WordPress blog.
2. Click on the "Plugins" tab in the left menu.
3. Select "Add New."
4. Click on "Upload" at the top of the page.
5. Select the 'better-click-to-tweet.zip' on your computer, and upload. Activate the plugin once it is uploaded.

**To install the plugin manually with FTP:**

1. Unzip the 'better-click-to-tweet.zip' file. Upload that folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Login to your WordPress dashboard and activate the plugin through the "Plugins" tab in the left menu.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are there other style options? =
Yes! If you are a developer or handy with CSS, there are [limitless options for styling](http://benlikes.us/bcttcustom "custom style for Better Click To Tweet").

If you are not a developer, I have released a premium add-on for selecting among several (and growing) different style options. Check out [Premium Styles](http://benlikes.us/bcttps "Premium Styles for Better Click To Tweet")

= How does Better Click To Tweet work? =
Better Click To Tweet enables you to create beautiful Click To Tweet boxes in your blog posts. Once you've installed and activated the plugin, click on the settings link to put in your Twitter username, and save the settings. 

Then, wherever you want to insert a Click to Tweet quote, use a shortcode in the format `[bctt tweet="xxxxxxxxxxxx"]` replacing the `xxxxxxx` with your tweetable quote.


In the visual editor, you can click the blue birdy icon in the toolbar and a correctly formatted shortcode will be inserted in your text. For more info or clarifications, start a [support thread](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/better-click-to-tweet "support forum"). I'll actively answer.

= How does the URL shortener functionality work? =
Better Click To Tweet gives you the maximum number of characters possible. Allow me to explain:

Twitter automatically routes every link through its own URL shortener (you might recognize t.co as the domain they use). For their t.co links, the length is automatically truncated to 23 characters for URLs. This leaves 253 characters after the URL for you to use to compose your tweet. Even a link that is run through bit.ly or a yourls.org install is still routed through t.co in the tweet.

The benefit of URL shorteners goes beyond just character length, though. Many users use bit.ly or a similar service to track numbers of clicks and other analytical data. I personally use yourls.org to power http://benlikes.us for my shortened links.

Better Click To Tweet works alongside url shortening plugins to harness that power, if you choose to.

WordPress has a feature called "shortlinks" which changes the long URL to something like example.com/?p=3435. Various plugins in the official plugin directory exist to change that shortlink to one using other outside services. Using a combination of those plugins and mine, your Better Click To Tweet boxes can now display a trackable link.

On the settings page for Better Click To Tweet, simply check the box indicating you'd like to use the short URL, and save changes. If you've got a plugin that correctly hijacks the built-in WordPress shortlink functionality, you're all set! I've tested my plugin with the following plugins, and will make every effort to keep this list updated:

* [WP Bitly](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-bitly/ "WP Bit.ly")
* [YOURLS Link Creator](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/yourls-link-creator "YOURLS Link Creator")
* [Goo.gl](https://wordpress.org/plugins/googl/ "Goo.gl")

If you run into any issues with my plugin not working alongside a certain link shortener, start a [support thread](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/better-click-to-tweet "support forum") and include a link to the other plugin. I'll see what I can do to work with the other developer.

I've also written [a tutorial](http://benlikes.us/79 "shortlink tutorial") for how to set up the shortlinks with bit.ly and yourls.org.

= Are there any other hidden tricks? =
Yes! Because I want the majority of users (who aren't as concerned with options like nofollow links and getting rid of the URL in the tweet) to be happy, most options are hidden. I've written [a tutorial for using those advanced options](http://benlikes.us/7r "power user guide"). Most of those options are visible in the Gutenberg block, so that tutorial really only applies to the classic editor.

= What do I do if it's not working right? =
I am active in [the support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/better-click-to-tweet "BCTT Support"), and in patching the plugin. Start a thread there, and I will gladly help you out. Most of the time you can expect a day or two before a response. I'm in the eastern US, and I like playing with my kids at night, so you might not hear back immediately. Don't panic.

* fix — tested up to WordPress 5.0

* Fix — made the settings page more accessible with the help of Rachel Cherry's fantastic wa11y plugin. https://wordpress.org/plugins/wa11y/ Thanks Rachel!
* Started tinkering with Gutenberg compatibility, the new editor experience coming to WordPress, to make BCTT compatible with the Future of WordPress (no file changes on this, just wnate to let you know it's on the radar. Learn more at https://wordpress.org/gutenberg

= 5.4 =
* Enhancement — Now supports Twitter's new 280 character limit. Note that non-roman characters may effect the new truncation in strange ways. Please report any such strangeness to me in the support forums.
* Enhancement — updated some links in the back end to link to the all new (and still kinda bland) https://www.betterclicktotweet.com

= 5.3.1 =
* Security Fix — potential XSS vulnerability on settings page. (mild security risk only affecting logged-in administrator accounts previously compromised). Thanks Robbie at DXW @robbiepaul on Github for the responsible disclosure.
* If the last point didn't make any sense, please translate it to "UPDATE NOW. Previous versions of the plugin are mildly vulnerable to enterprising attackers."

= 5.3 =
* enhancement — cleaned up the various options checks that were happening on the front end (thanks @igmoweb on GitHub!)
* Readme changes. I also celebrated a milestone of 20K active installs, which was cause for great celebration, and at least one undocumented happy dance.

= 5.2.1 =

* enhancement — tested for compatibility with WordPress core 4.8
* but seriously, you should check out Premium Styles. http://benlikes.us/bcttps

= 5.1 =
* enhancement — I added a highly dismissable notice to the plugins page upon update, encouraging people to purchase my Premium styles add-on. The notice only shows to folks who have not previously customized their own styles, and once dismissed will never be shown to that user again.
* enhancement — I made several changes to the readme file so that the plugin is showcased nicely in the WordPress Plugin Directory's new design.

= 5.0.2 =
* fix — I was incorrectly calling translation module, breaking things when people updated to the latest version of Yoast SEO.

= 5.0.1 =
* fix — "subscribe" text on plugin settings page was not translatable.
* New customers are enjoying Premium Styles: http://benlikes.us/bcttps

= 5.0 =
* enhancement — settings page now looks good on mobile. Before it looked a bit like someone was actively hitting it with a bat.
* enhancement — added multiple action hooks to the settings page. This provides third party developers with the ability to add things to that page without hacking the core code.
* enhancement — made the function enqueuing the front end styles DRYer.
* change — the previous way (version 4.9) I had filtered the function enqueuing styles was throwing PHP warnings when I used it, so I introduced an options-based method for never enqueueing it in the first first place. Updated gist for that: http://benlikes.us/bcttgist2 This method will also pave the way for the most exciting update (for me) in the history of Better Click To Tweet:
* change — introduced the first premium add-on (Premium Styles), and made some changes to the settings page to facilitate that. The goal is threefold: (1) Don't introduce the option to folks who have already replaced the custom stylesheet using the power user guide http://benlikes.us/7r or by dequeueing the stylesheet using this gist http://benlikes.us/bcttgist1  (2) Introduce the option to purchase custom styles in a non-sleazy way. (3) Um, introduce the option to my tens of thousands of happy users to pay me for something.


= 4.10 =
* enhancement — added a 'prompt' shortcode attribute, so not you can change the words "Click To Tweet" on a per-box basis. Thanks to @apearlman on the Wordpress.org support forums for the suggestion!
* fix — changed the way the shortcode attributes are called, because my IDE kept throwing strange errors because the code wasn't clean enough.
* fix — removed some unused local variables because I used to not know how to code things good.
* dream — thought about ways to monetize this plugin, but ultimately decided against it for now, because I hate dashboard nags. But if you like it, donate: http://benlikes.us/donate
* change — decided to go with 4.10 instead of 5.0 in an attempt to move toward a version numbering system that makes sense, because I have learned much since 0.X --> 1.0.
* just for kicks and totally unrelated — wrote a cool post about rolling back WordPress plugins: http://benlikes.us/fk

= 4.9 =
* enhancement - Made the function that registers and enqueues the scripts filterable, so that developers who want to put all styles for Better Click To Tweet boxes in their theme files are able to do so using this snippet: https://gist.github.com/Benunc/533985231bbfde551d019620f628a921
* two updates in a row with no love for the non developer, but MUCH love for the developer. Trust me, this one is big time for CSS developers to be able to add styles to themes.
* changed some specifics in the FAQ, and the Readme in general. Encouraged people to donate at http://benlikes.us/donate

= 4.8 =
* made span classes filterable, so that other developers don't hate me when they try to extend the plugin.
* I know that first point doesn't sound like much, but it's huge for developer geeks. You're just gonna have to trust me.
* removed the names of translators from the "description" since they are now being handled by official language packs, and giving credit where it is due was getting complicated.

= 4.7.1 =
* updated links throughout the back end of the plugin to send me money, for people who are into that sort of thing. Shoutout to https://givewp.com for the SWEET donation integration on my site.

= 4.7 =
* added the ability to change the "via" addendum on a per-box basis using the new "username" shortcode attribute. The default behavior is (still) to go with the username you saved on the settings page. 
* (non-geek explanation of that first point) Now if you have a guest post by @KanyeWest, your Better Click To Tweet box can add "via @KanyeWest" automatically to your reader's tweets!
* made some changes to the toolbar popup in the visual editor to facilitate the new "username" attribute, limiting confusion and causing much rejoicing.
* Made unsuccessful attempt at getting Kanye West to guest post as the ultimate demonstration of the new feature.
* Tested for compatibility with the upcoming WordPress 4.5, and I don't mean to sound arrogant, but it pretty much NAILS compatibility with 4.5.
* Added a module that shows up when a user is using WordPress in a language for which there is incomplete (or non-existent) translations for this plugin. For users where there is a complete (+90%) translation, nothing will show up. But for users where the translation is incomplete, they'll be encouraged to help with the translation efforts!

= 4.6.2 =
* Removed extra (old and unused) js file.
* changed some back-end links to go to my new page, www.wpsteward.com
* realized that my use of tags in the WP repo miiiight have been a touch on the obnoxious and unhelpful side, so now I just use 3.

= 4.6.1 =
* Removed call to external twitter script for security concerns.
* changed some wording on the description.
